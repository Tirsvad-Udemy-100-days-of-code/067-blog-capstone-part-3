## Purpose

Decide whether the repository is ready to receive lecture documentation: it is described and tagged on the git host, it has the Python project configuration, the ignore rules, the Doxygen configuration, a README skeleton with the environment instructions, and a repeatable security scan.

## Deliverable

A pull request that adds `.gitignore`, `pyproject.toml`, `Doxyfile`, a README skeleton with venv, run and test instructions, the folders `src/` and `tests/`, and the project documents under `docs/`; plus the repository description and topics set on the git host.

## Go / No-Go Criteria

| # | Criterion (objectively checkable) | Go | No-Go |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Repository description is set and at least 5 topics exist (Gitea API) | Both present | Either missing |
| 2 | `pyproject.toml` requires Python 3.13 or newer and lists no runtime dependencies | True | Otherwise |
| 3 | `.env` is ignored and absent from the index | `git ls-files .env` is empty | `.env` tracked |
| 4 | README passes `framework/scripts/check-readme.sh` | Exit 0 | Non-zero |
| 5 | opengrep reports no High or Critical finding | 0 findings | Any finding |

## Dependencies

| Depends on | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| None | First gateway |

## Traceability

| Business Case objective / KPI / user story | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Objective 1: publish a described repository | [BC-001] |
| Objective 4: venv, run and test instructions | [BC-001] |
| Objective 5: no runtime dependencies, opengrep scan | [BC-001] |

## Ownership

| Role | Stakeholder ID (SA) |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | S01 |
| Approving reviewer | S01 |

## Target Date

2026-11-12 — inside the one-week constraint of the Business Case (2026-11-10 to 2026-11-17).

## Tasks

| # | Task | Summary | Needs its own Use Case/User Story? | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Set repository description and topics | Set a clear description and topics (for example python, flask, sqlalchemy, wtforms, udemy, 100-days-of-code) on the git host through its API, using the token in the personal `.env` that the project never reads or commits. Serves S03, who browses by description and topics. | No | |
| 2 | Add Python .gitignore | Add the standard Python ignore rules, plus `.venv/`, `.env` and doxygen output, so that the environment and the personal tokens never enter the repository. | No | |
| 3 | Add pyproject.toml | Configure the project for Python 3.13 or newer with pytest settings and an empty runtime dependency list, so S03 has nothing to install or trust. | No | |
| 4 | Add Doxyfile | Add a Doxygen configuration for `src/` so Doxygen comments in later code produce documentation. | No | |
| 5 | Add README skeleton and environment instructions | Create the README from the framework template with the project purpose, how to create and use a local `.venv`, `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, and how to run the project and its tests. Serves S02. | No | |
| 6 | Add src and tests folder layout | Create the `src/` and `tests/` folders the project uses, each with a short README, so the agreed structure is visible although no code is written. | No | |
| 7 | Run opengrep scan before push | Run `~/.opengrep/cli/latest/opengrep.exe` locally over the repository before each push and record the result, so no finding reaches the git host. | No | |
| 8 | Keep the AI prompt log | Record the session prompts in `docs/ai-prompts/` as the framework process says; ignore the folder if the repository becomes public. | No | |
