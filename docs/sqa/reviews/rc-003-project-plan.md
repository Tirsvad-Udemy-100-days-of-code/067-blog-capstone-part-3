## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | Metadata has `Language | en` and `Domain | it`. |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | `en` is BCP 47; `it` is in the registry domain list. |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | AI proposal: the content is English throughout. Only S01 may confirm (no stand-in). Confirmed by S01 by accepting the plan in chat, 2026-11-10. |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | Register is the one the registry gives for this type. |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | AI proposal: only common IT terms are used and no domain dictionary exists yet. Only S01 may confirm. Confirmed by S01 by accepting the plan in chat, 2026-11-10. |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | Metadata keys, headings, IDs and statuses are English. |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No translated twin exists. |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | Pass | First version; no earlier language. |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | AI proposal: terms are used correctly. A reviewer competent in the domain must confirm: S01. Confirmed by S01 by accepting the plan in chat, 2026-11-10. |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Fail | Optional. Acronyms such as PO, SQA, QC and API are used without being spelled out on first use. |

## Overall Verdict

Go — every Mandatory criterion passes; criteria 3, 5 and 9 of QC-LANG-001 were confirmed by S01 (plan acceptance in chat, 2026-11-10). Only the Optional criterion 10 (acronyms) fails and does not block; it has an action item. Mode: autonomous, not independent.

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spell out acronyms (PO, SQA, QC, API) on first use (optional criterion 10) | S01 | 2026-11-12 |
