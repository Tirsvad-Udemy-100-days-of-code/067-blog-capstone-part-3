## 🧭 Overview

The Day 67 lecture takes the blog further: the posts come from a SQLite database (`posts.db`) through Flask-SQLAlchemy, and you can read, create, edit and delete posts inside the website, with WTForms and a CKEditor field for the post body.

This repository documents what the lecture teaches. It holds **no application code**; the code belongs to the course. The lecture steps with screenshots are added in the next milestone, and the wiki explains what each step teaches, in English, Danish and Bahasa Malaysia.

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/` | Project documents, the wiki source (`docs/wiki/`) and screenshots |
| `src/` | Reserved for source code (empty) |
| `tests/` | Reserved for `pytest` tests (empty) |
| `framework/` | The SQA and QC framework the project follows |

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer (`python --version`), needed for the virtual environment and `pytest`.
- `git`, to clone the repository.
- Optional: [Doxygen][doxygen], to build the source documentation from the `Doxyfile`.

There are no runtime dependencies.

## 🛠️ Setup

Create and use a local virtual environment named `.venv` in the repository root, then upgrade `pip`.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pytest
```

macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pytest
```

Leave the environment with `deactivate`. The `.venv` folder is ignored by git.

## ▶️ Run

There is nothing to run: the repository documents the lecture. Read the [wiki][wiki]. To build the (currently empty) source documentation:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

## 🧪 Tests

With the environment active:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

There is no code yet, so pytest reports "no tests ran" (exit code 5).

## 📄 License

See [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
